Shopper

Random Shop generator for D&D 3.

TODO:
* Manually add item to shop inventory with custom price (should search in db if there is any item with same name)
* Manually remove item from shop inventory with custom price (price should be adjustable)
* Save/load shop in JSON files
* Graphic interface (flask?)
