You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2- pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.</p> <p>Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it might step on one. The caltrops make an attack roll (base attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the creature’s shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the creature has stepped on one. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature’s speed is reduced by one-half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical curing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.</p> <p>Caltrops may not be effective against unusual opponents.</p>"

An entangled creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.</p> <p>A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by the goo must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of universal solvent to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.</p>"

It weighs 10 pounds.</p> <p>The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.</p> <ul>   <li>     <p>Hold person upon touch, if the wielder so commands (Will DC 14 negates). The wielder must choose to use this power and then succeed on a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost.</p>   </li>   <li>     <p>Fear upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires (10-foot maximum range, Will DC 16 partial). Invoking this power is a standard action.</p>   </li>   <li>     <p>Deal 2d4 hit points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack (Will DC 17 half ) and cure the wielder of a like amount of damage. The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with hold person.</p>   </li> </ul> <p>The following weapon functions of the rod have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.</p> <ul>   <li>     <p>In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +2 light mace.</p>   </li>   <li>     <p>When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +1 flaming longsword. A blade springs from the ball, with the ball itself becoming the sword’s hilt. The weapon lengthens to an overall length of 4 feet.</p>   </li>   <li>     <p>When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +4 battleaxe. A wide blade springs forth at the ball, and the whole lengthens to 4 feet.</p>   </li>   <li>     <p>When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +3 shortspear or +3 longspear. The spear blade springs forth, and the handle can be lengthened up to 12 feet (wielder’s choice), for an overall length of from 6 feet to 15 feet. At its 15-foot length, the rod is suitable for use as a lance.</p>   </li> </ul> <p>The following other functions of the rod also have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.</p> <ul>   <li>     <p>Climbing pole/ladder. When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in granite is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars three inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the pole by pushing button 5.</p>   </li>   <li>     <p>The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod’s base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength modifier of +12.</p>   </li>   <li>     <p>When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the wielder a knowledge of his approximate depth beneath the surface or height above it.</p>   </li> </ul> <p>Strong enchantment, evocation, necromancy, and transmutation; CL 19th; Craft Rod, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, inflict light wounds, bull’s strength, flame blade, hold person, fear; Price 70,000 gp.</p> <p><b>"

It has the following powers:</p>  <ul> <li><a href=\"spellsMtoO.html#magic-missile\">Magic missile</a> (1 charge)</li> <li><a href=\"spellsPtoR.html#ray-of-enfeeblement\">Ray of enfeeblement</a> (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)</li> <li><a href=\"spellsC.html#continual-flame\">Continual flame</a> (1 charge)</li> <li><a href=\"spellsHtoL.html#levitate\">Levitate</a> (1 charge)</li> <li><a href=\"spellsHtoL.html#lightning-bolt\">Lightning bolt</a> (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)</li> <li><a href=\"spellsFtoG.html#fireball\">Fireball</a> (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)</li> <li><a href=\"spellsC.html#cone-of-cold\">Cone of cold</a> (2 charges)</li> <li><a href=\"spellsHtoL.html#hold-monster\">Hold monster</a> (2 charges)</li> <li><a href=\"spellsTtoZ.html#wall-of-force\">Wall of force</a> (in a 10-ft.-diameter hemisphere around the caster only) (2 charges)</li> <li><a href=\"spellsFtoG.html#globe-of-invulnerability\">Globe of invulnerability</a> (2 charges)</li> </ul> <p>The wielder of a staff of power gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and saving throws. The staff is also a +2 quarterstaff, and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (as a free action), the staff causes double damage (x3 on a critical hit) for 1 round.</p> <p>A staff of power can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot radius. All within 2 squares of the broken staff take points of damage equal to 8 x the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take 6 x the number of charges in damage, and those 5 or 6 squares distant take 4 x the number of charges in damage. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half.</p> <p>The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence, but if he does not, the explosive release of spell energy destroys him. Only certain items, including the staff of the magi and the staff of power, are capable of being used for a retributive strike.</p> <p>After all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a +2 quarterstaff. (Once empty of charges, it cannot be used for a retributive strike.)</p> <p>Strong varied; CL 15th; Craft Staff, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, magic missile, heightened ray of enfeeblement, continual flame, levitate, heightened fireball, heightened lightning bolt, cone of cold, hold monster, wall of force, globe of invulnerability; Price 211,000 gp.</p>"

Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: ten diamonds, twenty rubies, thirty fire opals, and forty opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crownlike, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels’ functions are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Diamond: Prismatic spray (save DC 20)</li> <li>Ruby: Wall of fire</li> <li>Fire opal: Fireball (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half )</li> <li>Opal: Daylight</li> </ul> <p>The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a helm of brilliance also has the following magical properties when activated.</p> <ul> <li>   <p>It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range.</p> </li> <li>   <p>The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a flaming weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a flaming weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect.</p> </li> <li>   <p>The helm provides resistance to fire 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it.</p> <p>If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become prismatic sprays that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line walls of fire extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become fireballs centered on the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.</p> <p>Strong varied; CL 13th; Craft Wondrous Item, detect undead, fireball, flame blade, light, prismatic spray, protection from energy, wall of fire; Price 125,000 gp; Weight 3 lb.</p>"
